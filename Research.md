I mostly do theory, data analysis, and machine learning in cosmology. Still, I would love to dig into actual observations whenever it happens.
Most of the questions that keep me awake at night circle around finding the best cosmological model and theory of gravity.

My research interests include many specific questions, from the evolution and formation of the supermassive black holes to the nature of dark matter and dark energy, large-scale structure formation, and tracing the seed for the structures in the early universe. I also have intense feelings toward the concept of Primordial Black Holes =)) !!


Here you will find some of my open source projects. The list will be updated over time.
