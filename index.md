I’m a 5th-year undergraduate physics student at [Sharif University of Technology](https://en.sharif.edu/)(SUT) currently wandering in Germany! I’m a research intern at the data analysis group in [Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics](https://www.aei.mpg.de/) - Hannover. I work on the mystery of the universe’s acceleration using the observed gravitational waves by the LIGO-Virgo collaboration. Previously I was a research intern at the High-z group in [Max Planck Institue for Astronomy](https://www.mpia.de/en) - Heidelberg, where I was investigating the IGM’s Helium re-ionization epoch. Ahead of that, I was a research assistant at SUT, working on deep learning dark matter structure formation.

I mostly do theory, data analysis, and machine learning in cosmology. Still, I would love to dig into actual observations whenever it happens.
Most of the questions that keep me awake at night circle around finding the best cosmological model and theory of gravity.

My research interests include many specific questions, from the evolution and formation of the supermassive black holes to the nature of dark matter and dark energy, large-scale structure formation, and tracing the seed for the structures in the early universe. I also have intense feelings toward the concept of Primordial Black Holes =)) !!
