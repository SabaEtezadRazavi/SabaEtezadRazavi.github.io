## About Me

I’m a 5th-year undergraduate physics student at [Sharif University of Technology](https://en.sharif.edu/)(SUT) currently wandering in Germany! I’m a research intern at the data analysis group in [Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics](https://www.aei.mpg.de/) - Hannover. I work on the mystery of the universe’s acceleration using the observed gravitational waves by the LIGO-Virgo collaboration. Previously I was a research intern at the High-z group in [Max Planck Institue for Astronomy](https://www.mpia.de/en) - Heidelberg, where I was investigating the IGM’s Helium re-ionization epoch. Ahead of that, I was a research assistant at SUT, working on deep learning dark matter structure formation.
