## About Me

I'm a theoretical physicist seeking ways to bring together experiments and theoretical concepts in Quantum Gravity(QG), the holy grail of physics.
My interest spans a wide range of topics related to the Phenomenology of Quantum Gravity (or PQG or Pretty Quantum Gravity!) using different tools, observations, and table-top experiments. I have experience working with large cosmological data and simulations as well as exploring ways to operationally approach the question of Quantum Gravity using Quantum Information tools in table-top experiments. You can read more about my research in the research section.
This is an exciting time for Quantum Gravity. After decades of pure theoretical efforts in the field, recent progress in multi-messenger astronomy and quantum technology enabling table-top experiments for QG has opened new promising windows to finally ask our questions from nature directly. Stay tuned!
